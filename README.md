## **About NextBid**

NextBid is a private auction marketplace demo built for **QHacks 2025**.  
Traditional marketplace bidding apps are often cluttered and uninspiring, catering only to those with specific shopping goals. NextBid changes that by offering a streamlined, engaging experience that connects buyers and sellers directly.

### **Why NextBid?**
For buyers, NextBid feels like **Tinder**:  
- Swipe left on items you’re not interested in.  
- Swipe right on items you like.  
- Start bidding instantly on live offers.  
Each interaction is recorded to help the AI deliver more personalized and targeted product recommendations.

For sellers, it’s as simple as:  
1. Take a photo of the item you want to sell.  
2. Let the **AI model** generate the title, condition, ideal price, and connect your item to the right buyers.  

When buyers see a product, it’s one they’ll want to bid on immediately.
